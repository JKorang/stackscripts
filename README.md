# Linode StackScripts

## Tory's Gaming Server
This StackScript leverages user defined fields for setting parameters during the installation as well as choosing which server you want to install.  This currently installs Minecraft and Seven Days to Die without issue.  For Minecraft, Pterodactyl is also installed at the same time.  This will allow for management of the server from a web interface.  Next up: CS:GO.
